Utopia VCS is a simple and lite library for interacting with version control systems (VCS) in Utopia-PHP using adapters for different providers like GitHub, GitLab etc. This library is aiming to be as simple and easy to learn and use. This library is maintained by the [Appwrite team](https://appwrite.io).

Although this library is part of the [Utopia Framework](https://github.com/utopia-php/framework) project, it is dependency free and can be used as standalone with any other PHP project or framework.

## Getting Started

Install using composer:
```bash
composer require utopia-php/vcs
```

Init in your application:
```php
<?php

require_once __DIR__ . '/../../vendor/autoload.php';

use Utopia\VCS\Adapter\Git\GitHub;
use Utopia\App;
use Utopia\Cache\Adapter\None;
use Utopia\Cache\Cache;

// Initialise your adapter
$github = new GitHub(new Cache(new None()));

// Set and read values from environment variables
$privateKey = App::getEnv('GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY');
$githubAppId = App::getEnv('GITHUB_APP_IDENTIFIER');
$installationId = '1234'; //your GitHub App Installation ID here

// Initialise variables
$github->initialiseVariables($installationId, $privateKey, $githubAppId, 'github-username');

// Perform the actions that you want
$repository = $github->createRepository($owner, $name, $private);
```
