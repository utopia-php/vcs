# Utopia VCS

Utopia VCS is a simple and lite library to integrate version control systems like GitHub, GitLab etc. to receive webhook events like push, new pull request etc. This library is aiming to be as simple and easy to learn and use. This library is maintained by the [Appwrite team](https://appwrite.io).

Although this library is part of the [Utopia Framework](https://github.com/utopia-php/framework) project, it is dependency free and can be used as standalone with any other PHP project or framework.
