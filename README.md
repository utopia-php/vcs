Utopia VCS is a simple and lite library for interacting with version control systems (VCS) in Utopia-PHP using adapters for different providers like GitHub, GitLab etc. This library is aiming to be as simple and easy to learn and use. This library is maintained by the [Appwrite team](https://appwrite.io).

## Getting Started

Install using composer:
```bash
composer require utopia-php/vcs
```

Init in your application:
```php
<?php

require_once __DIR__ . '/../../vendor/autoload.php';

use Utopia\VCS\Adapter\Git\GitHub;

// Initialise your adapter
$github = new GitHub();

// Your GitHub app private key. You can generate this from your GitHub App settings.
$privateKey = 'your-github-app-private-key';

// Your GitHub App ID. You can find this in the GitHub App dashboard.
$githubAppId = 'your-github-app-id';

// Your GitHub App installation ID. You can find this in the GitHub App installation settings.
$installationId = 'your-github-app-installation-id';

// Initialise variables
$github->initialiseVariables($installationId, $privateKey, $githubAppId, 'github-username');

// Perform the actions that you want, ex: create repository
$owner = '<repository-owner>';
$name = '<repository-name>';
$isPrivate = true; // Set to false if you want to create a public repository
$repository = $github->createRepository($owner, $name, $private);
```
