Utopia VCS is a simple and lite library for interacting with version control systems (VCS) in Utopia-PHP using adapters for different providers like GitHub, GitLab etc. This library is aiming to be as simple and easy to learn and use. This library is maintained by the [Appwrite team](https://appwrite.io).

## Getting Started

Install using composer:
```bash
composer require utopia-php/vcs
```

Init in your application:
```php
<?php

require_once __DIR__ . '/../../vendor/autoload.php';

use Utopia\VCS\Adapter\Git\GitHub;

// Initialise your adapter
$github = new GitHub();

// Your GitHub app private key. You can generate this from your GitHub App settings.
$privateKey = 'your-github-app-private-key';

// Your GitHub App ID. You can find this in the GitHub App dashboard.
$githubAppId = 'your-github-app-id';

// Your GitHub App installation ID. You can find this in the GitHub App installation settings.
$installationId = 'your-github-app-installation-id';

// Initialise variables
$github->initializeVariables($installationId, $privateKey, $githubAppId);

// Perform the actions that you want, ex: create repository
$owner = '<repository-owner>';
$name = '<repository-name>';
$isPrivate = true; // Set to false if you want to create a public repository
$repository = $github->createRepository($owner, $name, $private);
```

### Environment Variables
To configure your GitHub App properly, you'll need to set up the following environment variables in your environment or configuration file. These values are crucial for authenticating and interacting with the GitHub API on behalf of your GitHub App.

1. *PRIVATE_KEY*: You can generate this from your GitHub App settings.
```bash
PRIVATE_KEY = your-github-app-private-key
```
2. *GITHUB_APP_ID*: You can find this in the GitHub App dashboard.
```bash
GITHUB_APP_ID = your-github-app-id
```
3. *INSTALLATION_ID*: You can find this in the GitHub App installation settings after installation.
```bash
INSTALLATION_ID = your-github-app-installation-id
```

Remember to replace the placeholders (*your-github-app-private-key*, *your-github-app-id*, and *your-github-app-installation-id*) with the actual values from your GitHub App configuration.
By using these environment variables, you can ensure that sensitive information is kept separate from your codebase and can be easily managed across different environments without exposing sensitive data.
